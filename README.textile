h1. TEX-UPMETHODOLOGY

h2. Introduction

@tex-upmethodology@ is a (La)TeX style that enables you to create Unified Process methodology (UP or RUP) based documents (document version, history, authors, validators, specification, task management, helping tools...) with LaTeX. It offers a template that may be used to automate revisions, or simply to make it easier to collaborate on text based documentation that can be managed through a version control system with ease.

Because the @tex-upmethodology@ package package is based on external definitions of layouts and styles, it has also been used successfully to write and publish scientific documents such as *reports*, *engineering theses*, *master theses*, and *PhD theses*.  An example of PhD thesis styles based on tex-upmethodology may be found at: http://www.multiagent.fr/ThesisStyle

# usually @/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/upmethodology@ or @$HOME/.texmf@ on Unix

 $> mktexlsr
